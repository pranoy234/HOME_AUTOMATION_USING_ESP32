# HOME_AUTOMATION_USING_ESP32
Today we are in a modern era of technology such as “Blockchain technology, Quantum computing, and web 3.0”. The Internet of things merged in our IoT (Internet of Things) is a rapidly growing network of interconnected devices that can communicate and exchange data with each other over the internet. This is the first technology that can connect to the cloud platform. These devices can be anything from sensors and cameras to household appliances and vehicles, and they are designed to collect, analyze, and share data in real time. Home automation is the technology that helps a homeowner control various household things such as lights,ac, fans, etc. through the Internet. Home automation generally consists of a central controller, which is responsible for the coordination of household electronic things. The controller is programmed to control various tasks and 
generally, it is controlled by mobile phone through the internet and cloud. The cloud refers to a network of remote servers that are used to store, manage and process data over the internet.  IoT cloud refers to the cloud-based platform that can be used for processing, collecting, storing, and analyzing data from connected IoT devices, we are using Blynk cloud in this project. We are using the ESP32 chip which is a microcontroller with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth.
